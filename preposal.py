# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

# For our final project we are debating between making a snake game, a tron
# game, or a financial advice software to help people with investing based on
# their age, income, and amount wanting to invest

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Collaborating on project: Evan Burleson and Roman Jackson 

## Do you have any questions of your own?

# I know just a snake game by itself would not be complex enough but would us
# coding a tron game by itself be complex enough because we would have to make
# the turtles listen and that they would die when running into previously drawn
# lines and the boundaries around the game would have to be increased or turtle
# size decreased so that the game could be bigger and last longer.
