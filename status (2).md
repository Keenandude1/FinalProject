Defined the playing area, defined the tron bike itself in the form of a class, established boundaries for the tron bike,
established spawn points for both players

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Created difficulty level through user input, established speed at different difficulty intervals, set up keystrokes for
tron bikes to listen to

Identifying collission points, calling user input before the game runs, instead need to make text before game runs using a while statement.
